//EECE 4520: Lab 2: 3/20-23/22: 
//The code implimented for the python game; By Alex Skinner, Renin Kingsly Jose, and Johnny Nhem
// Specifically using the Gyroscope module; (GY 521 module) reading the analog pins read, then 
//writing the result tothe python code for its own functions.


//This was directly inspired from the examples provided by Prof.Liang-Min Wang. Including 
//The pdf. 'Lession_16_GY-521_Module.pdf': Modified heavily by Alex.Skinner
//For signifigant infortmation on how the analog pins 
//from the GY-521 module were read.

/*Notes During development: 

   *Inspired from the code currently produced by Renin Kingsly Jose and Jhonny Nhem: However since
   this relies on such different inputs, I'll have this be a completely different file (So far)
   
   *A clear difference from the example code is the nessesary variables and operations in order to
   obtain the changes in pitch and roll.(I won't use the yaw, since it shouldn't need to 'rotate')
   I'm adding the absolutely nessesary operations now in order to save space.

   *Currently adding the last code in order to have it write based on the read values: Here
    I had to edit the Alpha/ Omiga values to both operate for the X/Y rotations!
